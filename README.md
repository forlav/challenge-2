# Challenge 2

The idea with this test is to allow us to better comprehend the skills of candidates to developer jobs, in various experience levels.

This test should be completed by you on your own, in your own time. Take as much time as you need, but usually this test shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to be done.

## Delivery instructions

Download the instructions this repo and, once done, put all project files in a .zip file or a git repository and send it to your contact at Forlav.

## Project description

Your job is create an application to manage users and their respective virtual wallets.

Each user has one virtual wallet. Each virtual wallet has multiple entries for credits and debits.

Throu the web interface, you will need to:
- List users;
- Add a new user;
- Edit an existing user;
- Show the user's details including his virtual wallet current balance;
- Credit or debit money to the user's virtual wallet;
- List the user's virtual wallet entries ordered by date and time.

You will also need to create three API endpoints to:
- Credit or debit money to the user's virtual wallet;
- Retrieve an user's virtual wallet current balance;
- Retrieve an user's virtual wallet entries in a period of time.

Your application MUST:
- Be written in Ruby 2.4 or greater;
- Be written in Rails 5.2 or greater;
- Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite;
- Accept and return JSON in the API endpoints;
- Be simple to configure and execute, running on a Unix-compatible environment (Linux or macOS).

Your application doesn't need to:

- Deal with authentication or authorization (bonus points if it does, though, specially via oAuth);
- Use Docker (bonus points if it does);
- Be pretty.

## Review

Your project will be evaluated by the following criteria:

- Does the application fulfill the basic requirements?
- Did you document how to configure and run the application?
- Did you provide API documentation?
- Did you follow closely the project specification?
- Quality of the code itself, how it's strutured and how it complies with good object-oriented practices
- Quality and coverage of unit / funcional / automated tests
- Familiarity with the standard libraries of the language and other packages
